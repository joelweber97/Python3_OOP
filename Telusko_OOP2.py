#the class is basically the blueprint of the objects an dthe objects are the instances
class Computer:
    #two things can go into a class....

        print('i5, 16gb, 1tb')


comp1 = Computer() #constructor
print(type(comp1)) # returns <class '__main__.Computer'> which shows that it's part of the computer class

#either line below is a way to call the config method on the comp1 instance of class Computer
Computer.config(comp1)
comp1.config()

comp2 = Computer()
Computer.config(comp2)
